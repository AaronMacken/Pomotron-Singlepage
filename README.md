# Restful-Controller-Boilerplate-w-Express
This repository includes boilerplate for a back end restful controller
using Mongo Express and Node. 

Packages include: body-parser, express, mongoose, node-sass and node-sass-middleware.

The boiler plate repo includes:

- basic express config
- data model config,
- restful routes which use call backs,
- call back functions to execute index route, create route, show route, update route and destroy route.

After copying the boiler plate, developers can implement their own data models and
create an application on top of the restful controller.
